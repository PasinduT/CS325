# FORMAT_1: the format in which the output tree from Neighbor Joining
#           will be stored
# The tree will be represented in a recursive format, where each node will be
# stored as a tuple. There are two types of nodes. The topmost node of the tree
# has the following format:
#           (Node A, distance between Node A and Node B, Node B)
# the reason for this is that Neighbor joining returns an unrooted tree, which 
# means that one of the branches must be given individually in a node based 
# format. 
# The second type of node is the internal node. For example internal node Node U
# has the following structure:
#   (Child Node A, distance to Node A, Child Node B, distance to Node B)
# All distances will be in Python floats, and leaf nodes will be stored as 
# strings.

# FORMAT_2: the format in which the distance matrix will be stored
#

# This is the main function of the program

# FORMAT_1: the format in which the output tree from Neighbor Joining
#           will be stored
# The tree will be represented in a recursive format, where each node will be
# stored as a tuple. There are two types of nodes. The topmost node of the tree
# has the following format:
#           (Node A, distance between Node A and Node B, Node B)
# the reason for this is that Neighbor joining returns an unrooted tree, which 
# means that one of the branches must be given individually in a node based 
# format. 
# The second type of node is the internal node. For example internal node Node U
# has the following structure:
#   (Child Node A, distance to Node A, Child Node B, distance to Node B)
# All distances will be in Python floats, and leaf nodes will be stored as 
# strings.

# FORMAT_2: the format in which the distance matrix will be stored
# Since most parts of the program requires a distance matrix between each 
# pair of sequences. We had to implement a version of a distance matrix. 
# Using a 2 dimensional array would require us to enumerate the sequences in a 
# way, preventing us from caching the results from a previous run at computing 
# the distances. Therefore we decided to use a structure consisting of nested
# dictionaries, where the both names and distances would be stored. For example,
# if we have the following distance matrix:
#        ___|_A_|_B_|_C__
#        A  | 0 | 1 | 3
#        B  | 1 | 0 | 2
#        B  | 3 | 2 | 0
# We would store it as:
# {
#   'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 3},
#   'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2},
#   'C': {'A': 3, 'B': 2},
# }

# This is the main function of the program
